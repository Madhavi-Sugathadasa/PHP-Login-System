 This is the example source code. You can browse through the version history and download the code. Better yet, you can fork this repository and make your own Login System.

 In this example we're creating a Login and Registration system using:
   - PHP
   - MySQL (and PDO, not MySQLi function)
   - JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax
   - Ajax will return JSON formats
